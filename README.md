# Unity-Starter-Project
Welcome all. This is the Unity introduction for the CSU AR/VR Club. The purpose of this is to familarize you with Unity, the currently prefered VR/AR platform with native support for multiple headsets. Over the course of these you will become able to install Unity, add assets, manipulate enviroments, and - should you chosse to - script using C#. After learing these basics you will have the knowlege base and skills required to expand in Unity development. The last piece will be a guide on how to port your program to an Oculus and some basics for the tools that the Oculus library gives you on Unity.

We hope you enjoy and if you are finding this for the first time and are interested, Meetings are every Friday 5pm - 6pm in the CS Building room 130 or you can reach out to one of our officers here. //Hyperlink About Us
